## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep, authoritative blue (#3F51B5), evokes trust, stability, and professionalism.
- Background color: Very light blue-gray (#F0F4F9) provides a subtle backdrop.
- Accent color: Complementary orange (#FF9800), brightens UI with positive tone.
- Body font: 'Inter' sans-serif, clear and contemporary.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' sans-serif, slightly more prominent than body for scannability.
- Use clean, easily recognizable icons for key features and benefits. Icons are consistently styled, preferably line icons for a modern touch.
- Employ a card-based layout for organizing information. Tabs structure key workflows like current setup, the upgrade scenario, side-by-side comparison and printable recap. Prominent color-coding distinguishes risk, limited and full benefits.
- Use subtle transitions and animations to enhance user experience (e.g., tab transitions, data loading).
